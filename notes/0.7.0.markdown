- Command line application is removed, because (according to bintray) nobody uses it anyway
- Library and sbt-plugin are merged into one project (because sbt multiproject is a mess)
- Index is not appended by default now (you can turn it on with `docsAddIndex := true`)
- Output directories are cleaned up before generating docs (you can turn it off with `docsCleanBefore := false`)
- literator-plugin is renamed to just literator and is now an auto plugin
