#Literator


This is a very simple program, which reads a source code file and transforms block comments into normal text and surrounds code with special syntax. So the aim is just to get a readable document from a code, which is written in more or less [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style. So the name is like "a thing which makes your sources literate", i.e. helps to use literate programming when it's not supported by the language.

So you can write your code and use markdown syntax in comments (which keeps your sources readable), and then transform it to a markdown document, from which you can generate a nice _html_ or _pdf_ or whatever else, using you [favourite markdown processor](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

The tool is written in Scala and first of all for Scala, because Scala doesn't have normal support for literate programming.


### Docco

Of course, there are plenty of [docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)-like tools, which generate htmls from your sources (also using markdown), but there are several reasons, why I don't like them.
- first of all, there is no normal Scala-clone of such tool and this is not nice, because I want to integrate this into normal release process of the Scala projects I develop;
- secondly, I want to keep things simple, and I like markdown as an "intermediate" format, for example it's handy to have just markdown documents on github, as it will render them nicely, and then generate from them htmls for a web-site, if needed, using your favourite tool and templates;
- finally, most of such tools support only one-line comments and ignore block comments, while I want the opposite: write comments as a normal text and have ignored small comments in code.

It just takes file name and outputs the result.
