This is a simple tool, which **transforms your sources into markdown documentations for themselves**. It just reads a source file, turns block comments into normal text and surrounds code with markdown backticks syntax. So the aim is just to get a readable document from a code, which is written in more or less [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style. The name is like "a thing which makes your sources literate", i.e. helps to use literate programming when it's not really supported by the language.

So you can write your code and use markdown syntax in comments (which keeps your sources readable), and then transform it to a markdown document, from which you can generate a nice _html_ or _pdf_ or whatever else, using [your favorite markdown processor](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

The tool is written in Scala and first of all _for_ Scala, because it doesn't have normal support for literate programming. But it should work for [some other languages](docs/src/lib/LanguageMap.scala.md). [Open an issue](https://github.com/laughedelic/literator/issues/new), if you want support for something else.

> Note: Before `v0.7.0` there was a separate library, command line application and an sbt-plugin.

Some extra features:

- it provides convenient list of links definitions for internal references
- it (optionally) generates index of the files in the given directory and appends it to each produced markdown file


## Usage

Just add following line to your `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("laughedelic" % "literator" % "<version>")
```

(see the latest release version on the badge above)

To run Literator from sbt, use `generateDocs` task.


### Setting keys

|               Key |       Type        | Default                  |
|------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------|
|         `docsMap` | `Map[File, File]` | `src/` â†’ `docs/src/`     |
|  `docsOutputDirs` |    `Seq[File]`    | same as `docsMap` values |
|    `docsAddIndex` |     `Boolean`     | `false`                  |
| `docsCleanBefore` |     `Boolean`     | `true`                   |

You can set `docsMap` key in your `build.sbt` to map source directories to output documentation directories. Using this map you can easily generate docs for several subprojects or integrate certain parts of the source documentation in the general docs (especially if you're using some service like [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)).

Note that output directories are _cleaned up_ before generating docs (you can turn it off with `docsCleanBefore := false`), so be careful if you're mixing generated docs with handwritten.

<!-- TODO: write about index and internal links usage -->


### Release process integration

If you use [sbt-release](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-release) plugin, you can add docs generation step. See sbt-release documentation for details.


## Example/Demo

If you have a piece of code like this (it's from the literator sources):

```scala
/* ### Block comments parsing */

/* - When parsing the comment opening brace, we remember the offset for the content
     Note that [scaladoc-style comments](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html)
     are ignored.
*/
def commentStart: PS =
  spaces ~ (lang.comment.start ^^ { _.replaceAll(".", " ") }) ~
  (((spaces ~ guard(eol)) ^^^ None) | // if the first row is empty, ignore it
   (guard(not("*")) ~> " ".?)) ^^     // not scaladoc and an optional space
  { case sps ~ strt ~ sp => sps + strt + sp.getOrElse("") }

/* - Closing comment brace is just ignored */
def commentEnd: PS = spaces ~ lang.comment.end ^^^ ""
```

Then it will be transformed into the following markdown:

    ### Block comments parsing

    - When parsing the comment opening brace, we remember the offset for the content
      Note that [scaladoc-style comments](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html)
      are ignored.

    ```scala
    def commentStart: PS =
      spaces ~ (lang.comment.start ^^ { _.replaceAll(".", " ") }) ~
      (((spaces ~ guard(eol)) ^^^ None) | // if the first row is empty, ignore it
       (guard(not("*")) ~> " ".?)) ^^     // not scaladoc and an optional space
      { case sps ~ strt ~ sp => sps + strt + sp.getOrElse("") }
    ```

    - Closing comment brace is just ignored

    ```scala
    def commentEnd: PS = spaces ~ lang.comment.end ^^^ ""
    ```

You can see the result of running Literator on its own sources in the [docs/src/](docs/src/) folder.



## FAQ

#### Is this project alive?

Yes, even if you don't see any recent commits/releases. It's just quite stable. In [@ohnosequences](https://github.com/ohnosequences) we used this tool in everyday development and as a part of the release process.

#### Can I help with development?

Yes, you're very welcome to contribute to the project. Check open issues with the [`help wanted` badge](https://github.com/laughedelic/literator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

#### Why not docco?

Of course, there are plenty of [docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)-like tools, which generate htmls from your sources (also using markdown), but there are several reasons, why I don't like them:

- there is no normal Scala-clone of such tool that you could integrate in the release process
- most of such tools support only one-line comments and ignore block comments, while the opposite makes more sense: write documentation comments as normal text and keep small technical comments inlined
- those tools claim to be "quick and dirty", IMO better to have something simple, but reliable
- Literator helps to keep things simple using markdown which is good as an intermediate format. For example, it's handy to have just markdown documents on github, as it will render them nicely and then generate from them htmls for a web-site if needed using your favorite tool and style templates

#### Related projects

There are a couple of interesting projects which approach literate programming in Scala from another side:

* [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) reads markdown files and _interprets_ Scala code in `tut` sheds
* [sbt-scaliterate](https://github.com/wookietreiber/sbt-scaliterate) generates Scala source code from a _programming book_ written in markdown
